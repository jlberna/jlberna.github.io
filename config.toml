description = [
  "My interest in technology led me to an Electronic Engineering degree and subsequently, a research technician role at Interact Lab and SCHI lab, now consolidated as UCL's Multi-Sensory Devices group. This experience prompted my pursuit of a PhD in haptic controllers for VR under Diego Martinez Plasencia supervision, while I also developed an open-source force feedback characterization framework for haptic controllers. A multifaceted maker, my expertise spans digital fabrication, VR, and electronics, and I'm intrigued by multisensory and ephemeral displays. I founded creative studio Bubaki Design with artist Catherine Ireton, creating interactive experiences that evoke wonder. "

Three driving-related messages (Slow down, Fill gas, Passing by a point of interest) were mapped to four scents (lemon, lavender, peppermint, rose). Results showed strong associations between the messages and scents, confirmed in a second study where participants expressed their preferences while completing a simulated driving task. The findings highlight the potential of olfactory communication as a modality in enhancing the in-car experience."

summary = "Traditional acoustic field control approaches use costly phased arrays or fixed lenses. This solution introduces quantal meta-surfaces, using pre-made 3D units called metamaterial bricks for phase delay encoding. By assembling these bricks, meta-surfaces can produce any diffraction-limited acoustic field, leading to acoustic focusing, steering and levitation. This approach simplifies acoustic device design and brings us closer to spatial sound modulation."
